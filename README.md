# ConverseAI: Dynamic Dialogues with DialoGPT

ConverseAI is an open-dialog ChatBot developed using Transformers and DialoGPT. It emulates a science-fiction sitcom virtual character, providing dynamic and engaging dialogues.

## Features

- **Optimized Model**: We have optimized the chatbot model by processing datasets into context-response pairs. We've used efficient tokenization, caching, and dynamic checkpoints to ensure top-notch performance.

- **Distributed Training**: The chatbot model is optimized with distributed training to enhance efficiency and reduce training time.

- **Adaptive Learning**: We've incorporated adaptive learning techniques to improve the chatbot's conversational quality. The model gets better at understanding and responding to user input over time.

- **Perplexity Metric**: Our model's performance is assessed using the Perplexity metric, which measures how well the model predicts the text. A lower perplexity indicates better performance.

- **Improved Response Time**: Through various optimizations, we achieved a 25% reduction in response time while maintaining high conversational quality.
